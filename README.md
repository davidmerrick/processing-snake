Implementation of snake game in [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## About

I mostly wrote this as an exercise in data structures, and partly to learn more about Processing. I encountered an interview question about how to implement this game, and thought it might be most efficient to use a [double-ended queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue) to represent the snake. That's the approach I took. The front of the queue represents the head, and the back of the queue represents the tail.

## Usage

1. In a Processing Java environment, open the ```src/snake/snake.pde``` file.
2. Run the code.
3. Et Voila!
